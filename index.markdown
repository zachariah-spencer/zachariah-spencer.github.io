<p style="text-indent:2em;">Over the past three years in Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program, I have evolved from a student with fundamental programming knowledge into a developer capable of designing, building, and refining full-scale software systems. My studies and projects, particularly the "Napitak" video game and "Travlr Getaways" full-stack web application, allowed me to demonstrate the core outcomes of the CS program: applying innovative computing practices, developing maintainable software architectures, and delivering professional, audience-appropriate communication.</p>

<p style="text-indent:2em;">One of my greatest strengths lies in software engineering and design. Through refactoring and restructuring complex code in my Napitak project, I showed my ability to identify architectural weaknesses and improve scalability, readability, and long-term maintainability. Implementing an EventBus system and dependency injection strategies displayed both creativity and discipline, traits essential to modern software development. These improvements align directly with my goal of becoming a software engineer who can architect and deliver production-ready solutions that provide real business value.</p>

<p style="text-indent:2em;">In the algorithms and data structures domain, I emphasized performance-minded programming through efficient use of Ruby's built-in data structures. By leveraging maps, arrays, and JSON-driven content loading, I demonstrated my ability to optimize runtime behavior and data management within a large application. These enhancements reflect my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and my capacity to balance design trade-offs in real-world codebases.</p>

<p style="text-indent:2em;">Within the databases category, I expanded my CS-465 web application to include dynamic data queries such as user-defined budget filtering, which improved user experience and interactivity. This project reinforced my ability to integrate front-end interfaces with back-end logic and database operations, an essential skill for full-stack and SaaS-focused roles. It also highlighted my proficiency in translating user needs into technical functionality.</p>

<p style="text-indent:2em;">Beyond coding, my time at SNHU refined my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly to varied audiences. Whether through written documentation, presentations, or collaborative discussions, I learned how to adapt my communication style to effectively convey technical reasoning. This skill is vital in industry environments where developers, designers, and clients work together toward a shared goal.</p>

<p style="text-indent:2em;">Overall, my ePortfolio demonstrates a well-rounded professional identity grounded in software architecture, system optimization, and practical problem-solving. It represents my confidence in designing solutions that are elegant, efficient, and aligned with organizational goals. As I transition into the professional field, I am prepared to contribute to a collaborative software team where I can continue refining my technical expertise while delivering innovative, high-quality products.</p>
